# Henry comments 13/April
- "great" isn't a very good commit comment :)
- SIDs still needed in this file.
- The changelog.md file needs to be formatted better. Put a date as a heading for each day you work, then bullet points for each item
- Not enough commits + changelog items to pass at this frequency.
- I couldn't find your text-based data. Create a root folder "data/" and put all your JSON files in there.

# Henry comments 17/April
- Changelog needs fixing (I made comments in there).
- data/ should be a directory (as you'll no doubt have many data files, not just one).
