My dear Prince Leo. You found your uncle is hidden in his bedroom with a few guards. You can kill him anytime you want My dear Prince Leo. However, your uncle got a question for you. If you can answer it correctly, then he will tell you where the crown of the king is. Otherwise, you will become the king without crown. It will be tricky. Answer it correctly. Good luck!
