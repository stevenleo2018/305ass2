We made some basic functions from week3. Also, we designed a atrractive story as the background story for this game. 
In addtion, we searched a plenty of resource such as images for the game.

In week 4, we build up the first beta version of the game, it has some basic functions such as intent in Android studio. And 
It has some playability but it is still not completed version. There are many steps need us to improve for this game.
Also, we prepared many candidate functions for our game.


In week 5, we have finished the function of GIF and we made the app icon. We create the function that passing data from one activity 
to another. And we tried to store data in external file. But we have not successed. And we failed to load and store data.
However, we will keep going to try. Because we just used half of time of this project.
